       README & CHANGELOG 12.1.0.4 - Ingva

 	  IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ!!!


Important information for users running on a lower version than XigmaNAS 11.2.0.4.6625
======================================================================================
Please download the LiveCD/USB image to create a new boot media.
We do not recommend an in-place upgrade via the firmware update page because of recent changes to the partition layout.
First, download your configuration file from the backup/restore page and save it. Then backup all other data partitions that exist on the boot media.
Now you can perform a fresh installation from the LiveCD/USB. After a successful installation, you should restore your previously saved configuration.

Install from scratch:
=====================
Download XigmaNAS® LiveCD or LiveUSB and boot.
The compressed LiveUSB.img.gz needs to be extracted first before it can be written to a USB media,
You can use it with Win32DiskImager or other tool.
Press 9 for the install menu. We recommand an embedded installation, never a direct dd.

** Embedded.img.xz is only for upgrades by WEBGUI, do not extract and write to any media for fast installs! **
It will be problematic as it doesn't make the required partitions that you need!


Upgrade note to "Full" RootOnZFS Platform users
===============================================
Users upgrading RootOnZFS from a revision lower than 6625, please go to: "Tools > Execute Command" and execute the below command
to upgrade to the latest rc.firmware script, this is a one-time only and not required beyond this revision unless noted:
~~~
fetch --no-verify-peer -o /etc/rc.firmware "https://sourceforge.net/p/xigmanas/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/etc/rc.firmware?format=raw"
~~~
Then go to: "System > Firmware Update" and Upgrade your platform Firmware to latest as usual.


Upgrade note:
=============
After upgrade you may need to clear your browser's cache to avoid display issues.

** After the upgrade please do make a new backup of your configuration! see: System|Backup/Restore on menu **

ZFS Upgrade note:
=================
Upgrade ZFS and add all supported feature flags on a pool only if you are ready for it!
Those upgrades can not be undone.


cifs/smb note:
==============
From Samba 4.5.0 and up the default value for the "ntlm auth" option has changed from "yes" to "no". 
This may have an impact on very old clients that don't support NTLMv2 yet.
Only if you really need NTLMv1 Authentication you can set in Services > CIFS/SMB > Settings on
Additional Parameters: "ntlm auth = yes".

ExtendedGUI note:
=================
Warning! Extended GUI is not compatible with this release.
Disable and remove the extension before upgrade.

Permanent Restrictions:
=======================
- It is not possible to format a SoftRAID disk with MSDOS FAT16/32.
- It is not possible to encrypt a disk partition, only entire disks are supported.
- AFP shares with TimeMachine support are limited to max. 4 shares.
- Tool iperf3 is not backwards compatible with iperf2.x. you must upgrade your client.


Minimum System Requirements: 12.1.0.4 series!
=============================================
Browser: IE 10 or higher, Chrome and FF or other recent browser.
Processor: Multicore 64-bit processor or better.
Boot device: 4GB minimum for "Embedded" platform, 4GB for Full platform.
Memory: "Embedded" 2GB minimum RAM, "Full" platform 2GB minimum RAM.
We always advice to use an emmbedded install on USB/CF/SSD media.

 *Note: LiveCD is not supported on swap mode except installation and upgrading.
Swap less install (not recommended): physical memory 2GB RAM or higher required.
With swap*: physical memory 512MB RAM + swap 512MB minimum (swap 1024MB is recommended).


Don't forget to backup the current system configuration before upgrading!

1. System|Backup/Restore Restore your config.
2. Disks|Management  click on Clear config and Import disks to update configuration.
3. Disks|Management|Disk Edit  After step 2, you will need to re-activate S.M.A.R.T.
   monitoring for every device.

 *Note  If you have RAID controllers but cannot parse S.M.A.R.T. info properly,
  please add correct variables in System|Advanced|loader.conf to load the correct
  kernel modules for controller support. Then reboot and Clear config and Import disks
  again to update the configuration.


Login error 403
===============
Do you have WebGUI Login error 403?
Ensure the PC is on the same network!
By default the System|General Setup Hosts allow field is empty so anyone on
the same network of the LAN interface can access the WebGUI. 
With a space-delimited set of IP or CIDR notation you can add computers from outer network.
As an example the outer IP address and LAN address for remote access.


HAST (Highly Available Storage)
===============================
It is still experimental in the WebGUI. You need CLI for some tasks.
To evaluate HAST, you need two of the same-configured XigmaNAS servers.
Currently iSCSI, CIFS, NFS, GPTUFS and ZFS on HAST is supported.
For master node of WebGUI, carp advskew is assumed as 0 or 1.
