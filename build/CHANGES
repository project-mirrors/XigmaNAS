NAS4Free 9.2.0.1 - Sandstorm-BETA
--------------------------------

Changes after 9.1.0.1.847

- Upgrade to FreeBSD 9.2-RELEASE.
- Upgrade zoneinfo to 2013f.
- Upgrade samba to 3.6.19.
- Upgrade lighttpd to 1.4.33.
- Upgrade php to 5.5.4.


Permanent restrictions:
- It is not possible to format a SoftRAID disk with MSDOS FAT16/32.
- It is not possible to encrypt a disk partition, only complete disks are supported.

Known bugs:
- If DHCP for IPv4 is used, the IPv6 statically configured DNS server will be
  overriden by the IPv4 DNS server.

NEED TESTING:
- IPv6: auto mode
- All services using IPv6 address (NFS, FTP, etc...)
- Netatalk VFS Samba module (automatically enabled when Netatalk starts) crashes
  samba when accessing to share
- Need to write an online-test procedure

Help needed:
- Need help for adding LDAP authentication feature:
  Main services can be easily authenticated using PAM-LDAP, but is harder for Samba.
