Permanent restrictions:

- AFP shares with TimeMachine support are limited to max. 4 shares.

Known bugs:
- If DHCP for IPv4 is used, the IPv6 statically configured DNS server will be
  overriden by the IPv4 DNS server.

NEED TESTING:
- IPv6: auto mode.
- All services using IPv6 address. (NFS, FTP, etc...)

  samba when accessing to share.

  Main services can be easily authenticated using PAM-LDAP, but is harder for Samba.
