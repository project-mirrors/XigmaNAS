NAS4Free 11.1.0.4 - Atomics
---------------------------
Changes:
- Upgrade to FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE-P1.
- Update translations.
- Add option to make USB devices available in virtualbox-ose.
- Upgrade virtualbox-ose to 5.1.26.
- Upgrade php to 7.1.8.
- Upgrade samba to 4.6.7.
- Upgrade syncthing to 0.14.36.
- Upgrade e2fsprogs to 1.43.5.


Fixes:


Permanent restrictions:
- It is not possible to format a SoftRAID disk with MSDOS FAT16/32.
- It is not possible to encrypt a disk partition, only complete disks are supported.
- AFP shares with TimeMachine support are limited to max. 4 shares.

Known bugs:
- If DHCP for IPv4 is used, the IPv6 statically configured DNS server will be
  overriden by the IPv4 DNS server.

NEED TESTING:
- IPv6: auto mode.
- All services using IPv6 address. (NFS, FTP, etc...)
- Netatalk VFS Samba module (automatically enabled when Netatalk starts) crashes
  samba when accessing to share.
- Need to write an online-test procedure.

Help needed:
- Need help for adding LDAP authentication feature:
  Main services can be easily authenticated using PAM-LDAP, but is harder for Samba.
