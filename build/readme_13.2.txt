=============
Download your configuration file from the backup/restore page and store it in a safe location before upgrading your system.

Install from scratch instructions:
==================================
- Download the LiveUSB file, extract the image, and write the image to a USB media. Alternatevely, you can download the LiveCD ISO file and write it to a CD/DVD.
- Boot from the LiveCD/USB device and perform a XigmaNAS® installation onto a new boot media.

Warning:
========
Do not shortcut the installation procedure!
The LiveCD/USB image contains a file called embedded.img.xz. Do not extract this file and write the extracted image to a media.

Upgrade notes!
==============

GEOM RAID5
==========
This is for current GEOM RAID5 users running on 12.x series!
XigmaNAS 13.x releases will no longer support GEOM RAID5, code was removed from the code base.
You will NOT have access to your DATA!
Migrate your data to ZFS first before upgrade.

Post-upgrade tasks:
===================
- You may need to clear your browser's cache to circumvent display issues.
- Make a backup of your configuration file and store it in a safe location.
- You may need to backup your databases and update your database tables to the latest version.

ZFS feature flags upgrade warning:
==================================
Enabling all supported feature flags on a pool can make the pool inaccessible on systems that do not support these feature flags.

Status Monitoring note:
=======================
Rev 9366 or lower Users that has enabled and setup System > Advanced > Monitoring Setup, They need to press there the button "Save & Restart" again after the upgrade.
That will make the new changes active for rrdtool and will provide the broken graphs again on Status Monitoring.

CIFS/SMB note:
==============
From Samba 4.5.0 onwards, the "ntlm auth" option has been disabled by default.
This may have an impact on very old clients that support NTLMv1 only.
Only if really required, NTLMv1 authentication can be enabled by adding "ntlm auth = yes" in the additional parameter field in Services > CIFS/SMB > Settings.

UNISON note:
=============
 unison has been updated to version 2.52. The new version introduces
 a new wire protocol and on disk archive format. This new version
 is compatible with 2.51 clients for communication, so it's now
 possible to upgrade one side and then the other.

 The archive files are automatically converted to the new version,
 but once they are converted they are incompatible with the
 previous versions of XigmaNAS version 12.3.0.4 revision 9009 or lower.
